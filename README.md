# reacthookexample
This repository is comprised of examples of react hooks. In reactjs, hook allows to use state and other react features in functional components without writing a class. Hooks are the function which hooks into react state and other lifecycle feactures from functional components.
React class components can have hooks for several lifecycle events. Hooks allow function components to access them too, in a different way. During the lifetime of a component, there's a series of events that gets called, and to each event you can hook and provide custom functionality.
